# $ command
A simple command to never hear `command not found: $` again!

### Motive

How often do you copy and paste something like `$ npm i some-package` or `$ git clone my-repo` before getting the following stupid error message?
> command not found: $

Frustrating, isn't it? Here's a simple solution that segues perfectly into installation instructions.

## Usage

Quite simple –– the `$` command will pass on all of its arguments as a new command.
